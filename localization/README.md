My code for a research project in localising patients in a mental health institute. This core talked with wearable modules that broadcasted their location to sensors in each room.

As the whole project is not open source, I am publishing only my part that acted as a logger and dispatcher of messages. 

code is (c) ALTAIR Robotics Laboratories.
